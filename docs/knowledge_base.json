  "founder_story": {
    "background": "Dr. Arielle Hammond is a local mom and longtime school principal with over a decade of experience leading schools, coaching teachers, and designing curriculum.",
    "motivation": "As a mother, Dr. Arielle wanted her children to fall in love with STEM from the very beginning. She and her husband dreamed that their children would one day reach for the stars (literally - becoming astronauts has always been part of the family plan). When she searched for programs that were hands-on, rigorous, joyful, and truly designed to unlock that kind of potential, nothing measured up. So she created the program she wished existed.",
    "philosophy": "Every lesson had to be something she'd be proud to give her own children. That blend—the precision of an educator and the heart of a parent—is what shapes Journey to STEAM today.",
    "hiring_standards": "We hire fewer than 10 percent of applicants, bringing on experienced educators and STEM professionals who see brilliance in every child. Each instructor receives hands-on training and coaching from Dr. Arielle to ensure that every classroom is a safe, joyful, structured, and truly enriching environment."

      "objection": "Can my child just attend a few sessions?",
      "response": "Our programs are designed as complete 8-week learning journeys where skills build progressively. Students get the most value from attending the full program, which is why we don't offer partial enrollment."
