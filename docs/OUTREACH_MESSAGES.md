**Subject:** I Built Your AI Chatbot — Live Demo Ready for Journey to STEAM

Hi Dr. Hammond,

I saw your Job post on Upwork for the AI chatbot project for Journey to STEAM, and I was really excited about it. I'm fairly new on Upwork and don't have a strong profile there yet to stand out from other applicants, so instead of just sending a proposal — I decided to do what I do best: build the actual product and show you.

I've built a fully working AI chatbot MVP for Journey to STEAM in about 2-3 hours. It's live right now and you can try everything:

**Live Demo Links:**

- **Chat Widget (try it!):** Add this to any page to see the chatbot in action:
  ```html
  <script src="https://widget-j2s.vercel.app/chat-widget.js" data-api-url="https://j2s-bot-production.up.railway.app"></script>
  ```

- **Admin Dashboard:** https://frontend-ecru-three-90.vercel.app/
  - Login: `admin@journeytosteam.com` / `J2SAdmin2026!`
  - View conversations, manage leads, edit the knowledge base, track metrics

- **Backend API Health Check:** https://j2s-bot-production.up.railway.app/health

**What's included:**

- AI-powered chat widget (branded with your purple/orange colors) — embeddable on Squarespace with a single script tag
- Claude AI integration with a 50-entry knowledge base covering your programs, pricing, FAQs, and policies
- Production-grade safety guardrails (prompt injection protection, PII detection, content filtering, enrollment confirmation blocking)
- SMS integration code via Twilio (ready to go — I just need business account credentials to activate it)
- Admin dashboard with conversation management, lead capture & CSV export, knowledge base editor, and real-time metrics
- Full documentation: architecture, deployment guide, admin guide, knowledge base management guide

Everything is deployed and working — backend on Railway, frontend and widget on Vercel, database on Supabase. The full source code is on GitHub with complete documentation.

The only thing not activated yet is the Twilio SMS integration. The code is fully built and ready, but I need the business account credentials (Twilio Account SID, Auth Token, and phone number) to connect it. Once I have those, it takes about 5 minutes to integrate.

I'll share all the project documentation with you so you can review everything I've built in detail.

I understand you might not see this message, and that's okay — but I wanted to show you what I can deliver rather than just talk about it. I'm looking to build my reputation and I believe in leading with results.

I'd love to work with you on this project and any future ones. Feel free to log into the admin dashboard, try the chatbot, modify the knowledge base, and see how everything works together.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

## INSTAGRAM DM — Message 1 (Initial Contact)

Hi Dr. Hammond! 👋

I saw your Upwork job posting for the AI chatbot for Journey to STEAM — really cool project! I'm new on Upwork and don't have a strong profile yet to differentiate myself, so instead of just applying, I actually built the entire working chatbot for you.

It's live right now — fully branded in your purple and orange colors, powered by Claude AI, with a 50-entry knowledge base about your programs, pricing, FAQs, and policies.

Here's the admin dashboard where you can see everything:
https://frontend-ecru-three-90.vercel.app/

Login: admin@journeytosteam.com
Password: J2SAdmin2026!

You can try the chatbot, view conversations, manage leads, edit the knowledge base — it's all working. Built it in about 2-3 hours to show you what I can deliver.

The only piece not activated is the Twilio SMS integration — the code is ready, I just need business credentials to connect it. Takes about 5 minutes once I have them.

I've prepared complete documentation covering everything I built. Would love to share the details if you're interested!

I know you might not see this, but I believe in showing rather than telling. I'd love to work with you on this and any future projects.

```

Everything is production-ready:
- Backend: Railway
- Frontend & Widget: Vercel
- Database: Supabase
- AI: Anthropic Claude

Full source code + documentation on GitHub — happy to give you access.

Let me know if you have any questions! 🚀

## INSTAGRAM DM — Short Version (if character limit is tight)

Hi Dr. Hammond! I saw your Upwork chatbot job and built a fully working demo instead of just applying. It's live:

Dashboard: https://frontend-ecru-three-90.vercel.app/
Login: admin@journeytosteam.com / J2SAdmin2026!

AI chatbot with your branding, 50-entry knowledge base, lead capture, admin panel — all deployed and ready. Phase 1 complete except Twilio (need your credentials).

Built it in 2-3 hours to show what I can do. New on Upwork, so I'm leading with results instead of reviews.
